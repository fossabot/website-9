Tuist is an open source project **driven by passionate developers** that devote part of their spare time to push the project forward. 

There are a lot of awesome features in the backlog that we'd love to build but unfortunately, not enough time to dedicate to the project.

If you believe in the [project's mission](/vision) and you'd love us to invest more time and resources into making Tuist the tool you'd like to use in your projects, we'd appreciate your finantial support. You can either support us on Patreon or Open Collective.

- [Support on Patreon ðŸš€]({{site.urls.opencollective}})
- [Support on Open Collective ðŸ‘¬]({{site.urls.patreon}})

With your support we'll **continue to design and build Tuist in the open**. Moreover, we'll develop all project components to be modular and in Swift so that you can leverage them to write your own tools. You can have a look at all the [open source projects](/open) that are already available.
